# How to order IBM Cloud Direct Link Connect
{: #how-to-order-ibm-cloud-direct-link-connect}

 * Verify your network provider's capabilities to reach the appropriate PoP and cross-connect into the associated Connect provider.
 * Use the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/) to open an {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Direct Link Connect request and complete the requested information. (Assistance from IBM sales engineers can be requested.) 
 * Contact your Connect provider and negotiate connectivity to your exchange.
 * Order connectivity between your network provider and the Connect provider.
 * Order a "virtual circuit" through the Connect provider, and refer the Ticket ID of the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} IBM Cloud Direct Link request as your "Request ID" or "Authorization ID"
 * IP assignment on the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} networking infrastructure will be completed within 3 business days after the virtual circuit request is complete.
