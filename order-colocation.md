{: tip}

## Before you begin
Before ordering Dedicated Hosting on Classic, review and ensure that you have met all requirements that are stated in
[Dedicated Hosting on Classic entrance criteria](/docs/direct-link?topic=direct-link-pricing-for-ibm-cloud-direct-link#dldh-entrance-criteria).

## Direct Link ordering process overview
{: #ordering-process-overview-dh}

Here is the general process to order a Direct Link Dedicated Hosting service:

1. Identify your colocation and connectivity requirements, and work with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} sales team to finalize and execute a contract and technical addendum.
2. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} runs a build order with the colocation provider for the requested environment and services. Deployment typically is completed within 30 days from when the build order is placed.
3. When the build of your colocation cage is complete, use the [IBM Cloud console ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com) to order Direct Link Dedicated Hosting on Classic and complete the requested information. You can request assistance from IBM Cloud Sales engineers. When you are ready to create your order, you are prompted to read and agree to the Master Service Agreement.
4. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} provides Letters of Authorization (LOA) for connections that use IBM Cloud. When you have the LOA, supply it to your colocation provider, then have them order a cross connect (and any required inter-campus connectivity) by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CFA (Customer Facility Assignment) information in the LOA.

  This process usually takes 2 - 10 business days to complete, depending on the facility vendor and the order priority you specify. It includes the setup of the patch for the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} termination port.

5. Provide {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} with the cross-connect completion notice from the facility provider in the IBM Support case.
6. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} verifies the completion notice's efficacy and orders the patch to be made from the LOA/CFA to the cross-connect router (XCR) and other gear.

Your IP assignment on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} networking infrastructure is completed within three business days after the cross-connect is complete.
