# Pricing for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link on Classic
{: #pricing-for-ibm-cloud-direct-link}

Pricing for Direct Link Connect, Dedicated, and Exchange "on Classic" offerings is consistent for equivalent regions and bandwidth, as shown in the following monthly pricing tables.
{: shortdesc}

The published pricing is for estimate purposes only. IBM must check with the colocation provider for firm pricing and availability. Also, Direct Link on Classic pricing does NOT include the additional charges by service providers to enable connectivity to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
{: note}

You, the customer, must arrange connectivity and billing with your service providers, independently of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. See the list of Exchange and Connect providers at [IBM Cloud Direct Link Partners](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/direct-link/partners). Direct Link Dedicated creates a Letter Of Authorization / Connecting Facility Assignment (LOA/CFA), which is usable by any service provider who can reach the **Meet Me Room that is specified** on that LOA/CFA. The provider who is connecting to the LOA/CFA must include pricing for the cross-connect in their quote to you; {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} does not order cross-connects on behalf of any customer.

## Dedicated Hosting on Classic pricing considerations
{: #dldh-specs}

Review the following planning considerations when ordering Dedicated Hosting on Classic:
{: #shortdesc}

- Direct Link Dedicated Hosting on Classic requests and pricing are handled on a transactional basis to account for regional differences in vendor availability and pricing.
- To obtain pricing, you must add both the Monthly Recurring Charge (MRC) and Non-Recurring Charge (NRC) prices listed in the preceding table, plus two Direct Link Dedicated connections at your chosen speed (for HA purposes).
- Pricing for space/power is not guaranteed until verified with the colocation provider.
- Remote Hands is $550 per hour with a one hour minimum.
- The Direct Link Dedicated Hosting minimum configuration includes one (1) rack with 5Kw of power and two ports for HA purposes at the chosen speed. More colocation add-ons are available.
- Deals involving a networking cage require custom pricing.

### Entrance criteria
{: #dldh-entrance-criteria}

- DLDH opportunity needs to be reviewed and approved by the Cloud Design Engineering (CDE) team before a quote is given. Existing IBM Cloud accounts can open the Direct Link Dedicated Hosting request through the IBM Cloud console and the IBM Support ticket will be routed to CDE for review. Pre-sales inquiries without an existing account can contact the CDE team at CloudEng@us.ibm.com.
- Minimum requirements – One cabinet @ 5kW with two Direct Links (for high availability purposes)
- Maximum total power capacity – 150kW
- IaaS consumption ratio – A minimum of 2 x 1 Gbps of Direct Link capacity per cabinet (that is, six cabinets require a minimum of 12 Gbps of Direct Link capacity into IBM Cloud)
- Metered power is NOT available. All power is billed in 5 kW increments, as a MRC.
- Dedicated Hosting on Classic is only offered as a 12-month contract term. Customers can renew or cancel with a 90-day notice.

### Process timeline
{: #dldh-process-timeline}

| Business days | Steps |
|----|----|
|  3 to 5 days | 1. Gather requirements. |
|  7 to 14 days | 2. Check availability, pricing, and create a contract. Time can be significantly shorter if there are no custom requirements. |
|  3 to 5 days | 3. Customer signs the IBM Cloud Direct Link Dedicated Hosting contract. |
| 15 to 20 days | 4. IBM signature of contracts / IBM signature of colocation vendor work order |
|  5 to 7 days | 5. Colocation vendor counter-signs the work order. |
| 30 to 60 days | 6. Cabinet is built out, power runs and cross-connects are completed, customer is onboarded. |

## Local routing
{: #local-routing}

Local routing is included with all {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link offerings. It includes access to all of the data centers connected directly to the local market, and it provides unlimited ingress and egress traffic across the Direct Link. If you need to route your traffic outside the local markets defined in the next section, you must add the Global routing option. Local routing does not incur any overage fees.

## Expanded IBM Direct Link local markets
{: #expanded-ibm-cloud-direct-link-local-markets}

To reach {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources outside of the local market in which the Direct Link is connected (at a PoP or data center), you must add the Global routing option, which expands your access to include all {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data centers, globally.

However, we have expanded our Direct Link local markets to provide more local routing options to our customers across the globe. The local market assignments are listed in the following table.

| Local Market | Sites |
|--------|----------------------|
| US South (Dallas) | DAL02, DAL03, DAL04, DAL07, DAL09, DAL12, DAL13, Denver 1, Chicago 1 |
| San Jose | SJC01, SJC02, SJC03, SJC04, Los Angeles 1 |
| Seattle | SEA02 |
| US East (Washington, D.C.) | WDC01, WDC02, WDC04, WDC05, WDC06, WDC07, Atlanta 1, Miami 1, New York City 2, New York City 3 |
| Montreal | MON01, MON02 |

| AP North (Tokyo) | SEO02, TOK01, TOK02, TOK03, TOK04, TOK05, Osaka 1* |
{: caption="Table 6: Local Markets and Sites" caption-side="bottom"}

For example, in the US South Market, Direct Link customers can send or retrieve data to or from any {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} location in the defined market (Dallas, Houston, Denver, and Chicago) without the need for the global routing add-on.

## Pricing for the global routing add-on
{: #pricing-for-global-routing-add-on}

Global routing expands access to include all {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} data centers globally. Bandwidth is unmetered and charged monthly based on the market. Details on the markets and other considerations can be found in our [FAQs](/docs/direct-link?topic=direct-link-faqs).

{: caption="Table 7: Pricing for the global routing add-on" caption-side="bottom"}

## Additional fees for customization
{: #additional-fees-for-customization}

Several customized, non-standard configurations are available for extra cost. Most of the fees are one-time fees for setup, denoted by "NRC" in the table. These options require an Exception review by the offering management (OM) and Special Network Services (SNS) teams before approval.

| Type of service | Fee |
|-----------------|------|
| SNS fee | $3000 MRC (monthly) per Account |
