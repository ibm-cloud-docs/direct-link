# How to edit the Link Speed for an IBM Cloud Direct Link Exchange connection
{: #how-to-edit-the-link-speed-for-an-ibm-cloud-direct-link-exchange-connection}

You can edit your connection's Link Speed on either side of the connection, starting from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} side or the Provider's edge server. You are allowed to change the link speed only once per month.

## Step 1: 

Follow steps 1 and 2 from the [Cloud Exchange ordering procedure](/docs/infrastructure/direct-link/cloud-exchange-automation.html).

## Step 2:

If the connection is in **Provisioned**, **Up**, or **Down** status, you can edit the connection by clicking on the **Actions** column next to the connection, as shown in the following figure.

In the order form, you can select the new Link Speed. As you select the Link Speed, you'll see an approximate monthly charge displayed on the left-side panel, as shown in the figure.

## Step 4:

Follow steps 2 through 5 from the [Cloud Exchange for Equinix ordering procedure](/docs/infrastructure/direct-link?topic=direct-link-provisioning-ibm-cloud-direct-link-exchange-for-equinix).

### Step 4A:
You must **AGREE** to the Terms and Conditions before you can place your IBM Cloud Direct Link order. Please read the Terms and Conditions carefully, because they contain important technical information that you must understand before proceeding. 

**Note: If you do not accept the Terms and Conditions, an error is displayed when you place the order.**

The figures that follow show the screens you may see, based on your selection at this step.

The following figure shows the Terms and Conditions screen with the error message displayed.
