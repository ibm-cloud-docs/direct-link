# Ordering Direct Link Exchange on Classic
{: #how-to-order-ibm-cloud-direct-link-exchange}
{: help}
{: support}

As you prepare to order Direct Link on Classic, review the general process that your organization follows for obtaining the Exchange service, including the locations where each service is available, globally. When you're ready to place your order, follow the step-by-step instructions.  
{:shortdesc}

To determine which Direct Link solution is best for your networking environment, see
[How do I know which type of IBM Cloud Direct Link I need?](/docs/direct-link?topic=direct-link-get-started-with-ibm-cloud-direct-link#get-started-solution-to-order)
{: tip}

## Direct Link ordering process overview
{: #ordering-process-overview-exchange}

Here is the general process to order a Direct Link service:

1. Verify your network provider's capabilities to reach the appropriate {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} PoP.
2. Use the [IBM Cloud console ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com) to open a Direct Link Exchange request and complete the requested information. You can request assistance from IBM Cloud Sales engineers. When you are ready to create your order, you are prompted to read and agree to the Master Service Agreement.

   If the Direct Link order is for the Equinix Cloud Exchange, the service provisioning is fully automated. This means that you can place an order for a Direct Link connection (Equinix) without opening an IBM Support case. Automation capabilities currently are limited to the Equinix Cloud Exchange.
{: note}

3. Contact your Exchange provider and negotiate connectivity to your colocation.
4. Order a virtual circuit through the Exchange provider, and refer the case ID of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link request as your Request ID or Authorization ID.

IP assignment on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} networking infrastructure is completed within three business days after the virtual circuit request is complete.

1. Log in to the Equinix Cloud Exchange (ECX) Fabric portal.
   * Navigate to [https://ecxfabric.equinix.com](https://ecxfabric.equinix.com).
   * Enter your username and password.

1. Review and click **Submit Your Order**. 
1. Return to the [IBM Cloud Direct Link Exchange page](https://cloud.ibm.com/classic/network/directlink/exchange) in the IBM Cloud console. Notice that the connection status for your direct link connection states **Create Approval Pending**. 
1. Open the Actions ![Actions menu](/images/overflow.png) menu and click **Accept**.
    
      ![Equinix request approval pending](/images/equinix-request-pending.png)

      ![Equinix order summary pane](/images/equinix-order-summary.png)

The timeline for approval is within 24 hours. If the 24-hour Service Level Agreement (SLA) is not acceptable, you can [create an IBM Support case](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/cases/form) and request that it be routed to the SNS team.
