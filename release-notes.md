Withdrawing of global routing network transit overage charges

Previous pricing included network transit allowances and overage charges for egress traffic outside of the customer’s local market. New pricing eliminates these network traffic charges. Henceforth, ingress and egress traffic across Direct Link connections do not incur overages.
