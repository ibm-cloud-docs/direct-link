IBM introduces a new Direct Link Dedicated release for VPC&mdash;the first of our next-generation Direct Link offerings.  Currently, this "limited availability" release is available only in the North America geography (Washington, D.C. and Dallas markets) with more locations being rolled out soon.

Highlights include:

* Metered billing, which lowers the barrier of entry to IBM Cloud.
* Support for connections to multiple IBM Cloud accounts from a single direct link.
* Support for multiple VPCs (without classic access) from a single Direct Link within the same account.
* Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) address to create native connectivity between your on-premises environment and IBM Cloud.

Capabilities coming soon:

* Support for Virtual Private Endpoints from customer on-premises from a single customer account.
* Support for connection to venues (CMS, Blockchain, SAP on Power, and more).
* Support for Direct Link connection to Public (for example, ICOS).

{: tip}

## March 2019
{: #march-2019}

March was a busy month for Direct Link.

* To enhance customer experience and provide greater value, the Direct Link global routing service was improved.
* We added several new partners for Direct Link Connect, which are listed later in this section.

Review changes in the [global routing announcement](/docs/direct-link?topic=direct-link-announcement-global-routing-policy-change).

### Expanded local markets
{: #march-2019-expanded-local-markets}

We expanded the Direct Link local markets to provide more local routing options to customers globally.

New local market assignments:

* The Dallas local market includes Denver, Houston, and Chicago PoPs.
* The Washington DC local market includes New York, Atlanta, and Miami PoPs.
* The San Jose local market includes the Los Angeles PoP.
* The Oslo local market includes the Stockholm PoP.
* The Sydney local market includes the Perth PoP.
* The Hong Kong local market includes the Taipei PoP.
* The Tokyo local market includes the Osaka PoP.
* The Chennai local market includes the Mumbai PoP.

View these changes in the tables in [Expanded IBM Direct Link local markets](/docs/direct-link?topic=direct-link-pricing-for-ibm-cloud-direct-link#expanded-ibm-cloud-direct-link-local-markets).

### Withdrawing of global routing network transit overage charges
{: #march-2019-withdrawing-of-global-routing-network-transit-overage-charges}

Network transit limits and overage charges for customers with the Global routing option are withdrawn. Previous pricing included network transit allowances and overage charges for egress traffic outside of the customer’s local market. New pricing eliminates these network traffic charges. Henceforth, ingress and egress traffic across Direct Link connections do not incur overages.
