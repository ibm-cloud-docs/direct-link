# Managing IAM permissions

To enable your users to view direct links, you must add the correct IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions. After you grant account permissions, your users can view direct link details by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console. The information or actions that are shown depend on your account's permissions.
