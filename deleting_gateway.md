# Deleting a direct link
{: #delete-direct-link-gateway}
{: help}
{: support}

You can delete a {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} gateway either before or after the gateway moves to the **Provisioned** state. However, you cannot delete a gateway during the **In review** and some **in progress** states.
{: shortdesc}

To delete a gateway, follow these steps:

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.dl_short}} table, highlight the row of the gateway that you want to delete, then click **Delete** from the Actions menu  ![Actions menu](images/overflow.png). 

   Alternatively, you can click **Actions > Delete** on a gateway's details page. 
   {: tip}
   
1. Enter the name of the direct link to confirm. Click **Delete** again to confirm the deletion. You cannot undo this action.

You can receive requests from your provider to approve or reject the deletion of a direct link. These requests are shown as "Delete approval pending" in the Status column on the Direct Link on Classic list page. To approve or reject a request, select an option from the Actions menu ![Actions menu](images/overflow.png), or click the **Actions** menu on the gateway's details page.
