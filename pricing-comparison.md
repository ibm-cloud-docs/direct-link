# Competitive pricing overview
{: #competitive-pricing-overview}

Enterprises choose to use private cloud interconnection, such as {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Direct Link for many reasons, including superior network performance, security and privacy requirements, and reduction of bandwidth costs. Although your company might adopt a private cloud interconnection network architecture because of the performance and security advantages, the associated reduction of network costs is a metric that clearly favors {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link in many usage scenarios.

## Why choose {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link?
{: #why-choose-ibm-cloud-direct-link}

IBM’s standard rates for Direct Link reflect a significant value for customers that use cloud resources on an active basis. This fact is borne out in calculating TCO for a Direct Link against its competition.

A 10 Gbps Dedicated Direct Link connection currently is priced at $4,999 in North America. This offering grants unlimited ingress and egress to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources across the connection. Direct Link does not have a metered option.

The following comparisons reflect the tipping point against hypothetical examples. The table at the end of this article shows a detailed summary of this price comparison, by geographic region.

## Company A
{: #company-a}

Company “A” offers a metered offering that lends itself to cheap ingress but significant variable pricing on egress.
* The Company “A” 10 Gbps pricing is composed of port hours at a $1,620 monthly recurring charge (MRC) plus a $.02/GB transfer fee on egress (in North America).
* For an apples-to-apples perspective to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link Dedicated, a Company “A” Direct Link equivalent 10 Gbps connection at 5% usage (or 170 TB) egressed in a month would cost a customer $5,020, versus $4,999 for a Direct Link 10 Gbps connection. Any data egress above 5% (or 170 TB) in a month would favor Direct Link’s flat rate pricing model.
* For a more stark comparison, assuming 20% usage (or 680 TB) egressed in a month would cost a Company “A” customer $15,220 in a given month versus $4,999 for a 10 Gbps Direct Link connection.

## Company G
{: #company-g}

Company "G" offers a metered offering that lends itself to cheap ingress but significant variable pricing on egress.

* The Company "G" 10 Gbps pricing is set at $1,750 MRC plus a $.02/GB transfer fee on egress (in North America).
* For an apples-to-apples perspective to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link Dedicated, a Company "G" Direct Link equivalent 10 Gbps port at 5% usage, (170 TB) egressed in a month would cost a customer $5,172 versus $4,999 for Direct Link 10 Gbps connection.
* Any data egress above 5% (or 170 TB) in a month would favor Direct Link’s flat rate pricing model.
* For a more stark comparison, assuming 20% usage (or 680 TB) egressed in a month would cost a Company “G” customer $15,330 in a given month versus $4,999 for a 10 Gbps Direct Link connection.

## Company M
{: #company-m}

Company "M" (like Company "A" and Company "G") presents a metered offering that lends itself to inexpensive ingress but significantly variable pricing on egress. Company "M" also offers an unlimited pricing table. Both options are compared in the next sections.

### Metered
{: #metered}

* The Company "M" 10 Gbps pricing consists of a port fee ($5,000 MRC) plus a $.02/GB transfer fee on egress (in North America). Right from the start, ANY data that is transferred out will be more expensive than {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link!
* For an apples-to-apples perspective to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link Dedicated, a Company “M” Direct Link equivalent 10 Gbps port at 5% usage (or 170 TB) egressed in a month would cost a customer $8,400, versus $4,999 for a Direct Link 10 Gbps connection.
* Any data egress above 1 TB in a month would favor Direct Link’s flat pricing model.
* For a more stark comparison, assuming 20% usage (or 680 TB) egressed in a month would cost a Company “M” customer $22,000 in a given month versus $4,999 for a 10 Gbps Direct Link connection.

### Unmetered
{: #unmetered}

* The Company “M” Direct Link equivalent 10 Gbps pricing consists of a port fee of $51,000 MRC for unlimited ingress and egress.

* For an apples-to-apples perspective to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Direct Link Dedicated, this monthly cost amounts to $51,000, versus $4,999 for a 10 Gbps Direct Link connection.
