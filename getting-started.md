# Getting started with IBM Cloud Direct Link on Classic
{: #get-started-with-ibm-cloud-direct-link}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Direct Link on Classic is a suite of solutions from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} network, with availability in locations around the globe. Each one enables customers to create direct, private connections between their remote network environments and their {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} deployments, without touching the public internet. Most commonly, these offerings are implemented to support private, hybrid, and cross-provider workloads, as well as large or frequent data transfers.

When you're ready to order, follow the step-by-step instructions for the specific Direct Link solution that you need. After you place your order, you'll be asked to complete a questionnaire related to your solution and workload requirements.  

   Currently, there isn't a migration path from {{site.data.keyword.dlc_short}} offerings to Direct Link (2.0). You must order a Direct Link (2.0) Dedicated or Direct Link (2.0) Connect connection.
